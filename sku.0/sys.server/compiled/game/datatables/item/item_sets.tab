1	3	set_effect_1_1	SETID refers to a unique group of items that will put a buff on the player (defined in EFFECT) when a certain number of items (NUM_ITEMS) are equipped from that set.
1	4	set_effect_1_2	Obviously you should use a new unique SETID for each unique item set.
1	5	set_effect_1_3	NUM_ITEM must be defined for every vaild item count from min to max number. If you want a set of 7 that gives a 3-piece buff and a 7-piece buff you must define 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
2	4	set_effect_2_1	In the above example, the EFFECT for NUM_ITEMS 3, 4, 5 and 6 would be the same.
2	5	set_effect_2_1	I'm trying to group SETID numbers by class.
